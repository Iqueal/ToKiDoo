# Getting Started with **[ToKiDoo](https://tokidoo.netlify.app)**

This project was created by **[Qurashi Akeel](https://tokidoo.netlify.app)** with **react js**.

## Features of ToKiDoo:

* You can save your todos and refer to them anytime you want.
* Since todos are stored in the local storage so nothing will be lost even after refreshing the page.
* You can delete todos when you no longer need them, just click on the delete button under the specific todo & that's it.
* If you fill the todo title & description fields but you donot want to save that due to any reason, you don't need to press backspace to clear the input fields, instead just click reset button that will clear both inputs in just one click.
* If you are done with the task you may want to add some kind of badge to that task, so that you can differentiate between the tasks done and the tasks which are not done yet, for that there is a button under every todo with the tag **Mark Done** click that option & your task will get the badge with **task complete**. 
* There is no chance of adding empty todo's as it will provide you an alert that you have not filled the title/description field when you keep respective fields empty.

## Please make sure to star this project.
